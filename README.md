# Telco Customers Churn Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The model leverages an **ensemble stacking approach**, combining multiple algorithms to achieve high accuracy in predictions.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for telecom companies, directly impacting revenue. This project uses a stacking ensemble model with the following base estimators:

- **Decision Tree**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **AdaBoost**

The final meta-estimator is a **Random Forest** model.

## Key Features

- Preprocessing pipeline for data cleaning and feature engineering.
- Stacking ensemble model combining multiple powerful algorithms.
- Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy and recall
- Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step implementation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or above
- Required libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `jupyter`
